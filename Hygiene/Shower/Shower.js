    Gather your supplies:

        Soap: A bar of soap is fine, but if you want to impress us, use a shower gel or body wash with a captivating fragrance.

        Water: Please use clean water, not some concoction you found behind the dumpster.

        Towel: A towel is essential for drying off after your shower. Please don't use a crusty old rag you found in your closet.

        Shampoo: If you have hair, use shampoo. If you don't have hair, don't worry about it.

        Conditioner: If you have hair that is dry or damaged, use conditioner. If your hair is healthy and shiny, you can skip this step.

    Enter the shower stall:

        Please don't stand on the toilet seat. That's just gross.

        Turn on the water and adjust the temperature to a comfortable level.

        Avoid staring at yourself in the mirror. We don't want to see your reflection.

    Lather up:

        Apply soap to your body and lather it up thoroughly.

        Pay attention to the areas that tend to get stinky, like your armpits, groin, and feet.

        Don't forget to wash your hair if you have it.

    Rinse off:

        Stand under the water and let it rinse away all the soap.

        Make sure to get your hair wet if you washed it.

        Don't forget to rinse out the shampoo and conditioner.

    Dry off:

        Grab your towel and pat yourself dry.

        Don't rub yourself vigorously. This will irritate your skin.

        Pay attention to the areas that tend to get dry, like your elbows and knees.

    Get out of the shower:

        Step out of the shower stall and dry your feet.

        Put on clean clothes.

        Congratulate yourself on completing this basic hygiene task.
